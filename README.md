# PROBLEM SPECIFICATION
A new Ride sharing company is entering the market in Lagos and they would like to make sure they don't mix up their commission from rides taken by independent riders on the platform. How can Flutterwave solve this? You've also been tasked to build them a demo page showing how payments are collected and split between the company and it's drivers (The demo page can be a web or mobile page and it only needs to show that a customer can make a payment and the funds are split between two parties.)
